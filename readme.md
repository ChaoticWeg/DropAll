# DropAll

DropAll is a script for [OSBot](http://osbot.org/) that drops all of a certain item.  It was designed as a useful tool 
for powerleveling skills like Mining, Fletching, or Fishing, whose experience is gained by acquiring items that don't 
stack.

DropAll **does not** play the game *for you*, like a normal bot script would.  DropAll simply automates the tedious and
repetitive task of dropping an inventory of items acquired over the course of skilling.


## Usage

To select the item to drop, hover over the item in your inventory and press `Ctrl-F`.  To begin dropping, press 
`Ctrl-D`.  You can stop dropping items at any time by pressing `Ctrl-D` again.


## Disclaimer

DropAll is currently *in development*.  It is open to the public for free use with OSBot.  Feedback is always welcome, 
though be aware that developmental builds are to be used *at your own risk*.

DropAll is designed to drop all of the items as quickly as possible, though a primary goal is simulating human input.  
Using a macro script of any kind is strictly forbidden by Jagex, and can carry the punishment of a permanent ban for 
your account.  DropAll's developers assume **no responsibility** for the irresponsible use of scripts including DropAll.
Use this script wisely and at your own risk.
